# Testing
All tests are ran within Docker containers via `docker-compose.yml`.

## Production
From the root of the project, build the test docker image, run docker-compose and run the test suite using the following commands:
```sh
docker-compose build sqler_dialect
docker-compose up -d
docker logs --details sqler_db
docker logs --details sqler_dialect
docker ps -a
# run the test suite
docker exec -it sqler_dialect bash "npm test"
```

## Development
From the root of the project, build the test docker image and run docker-compose using the following commands:
```sh
docker-compose build sqler_dialect
docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

From a different command prompt, run the test suite using the following commands:
```sh
docker exec -it sqler_dialect bash "npm test"
```

### Generating Docs
Once the docker containers are up and running, the docs can be generated by opening a command prompt and executing the following commands:
```sh
docker exec -it sqler_dialect bash "npm run jsdocp"
```

The generated docs can be viewed via [http://localhost:9099](http://localhost:9099)
